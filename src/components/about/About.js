            <p>
              As you probably figured out by now, I&apos;m Jon. I&apos;m a
              Front-end developer currently studying at KYH in Stockholm.
            </p>
            <p>
              For as long as i can remeber I have had a huge interest for games,
              software and all kinds of tech and hardware. As a young kid i used
              to build computers, play video games and engage with diffrent
              softwares. In other words I always experimented or explored any
              kind of hardware or software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on in life this interest became accompanied with a love and
              fascination for art and design in all it&apos;s shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore the career choice to become a Front-end developer felt
              like the obvious decison. Today I can&apos;t imagine a better
              alternative since I&apos;m loving every secound of my work.
